Veracode SCA Detection Targets
This code is specifically designed to trigger Veracode's SCA detection for:

jQuery 1.6.2 (CVE-2011-4969)

Vulnerable .html() method usage

Vulnerable .attr() method usage with javascript: URLs

Lodash 4.17.4 (CVE-2018-3721, CVE-2021-23337)

Prototype pollution via _.merge()

Potential RCE via _.template()

AngularJS 1.4.9 (CVE-2015-9251)

Client-side template injection vulnerabilities

Unsafe expression evaluation

Verification Steps with Veracode
Agent-Based Scanning:

The Veracode agent should detect all three outdated libraries

Should flag each library with their respective CVEs

Should identify the vulnerable method calls in the JavaScript code

Expected Findings:

jQuery XSS vulnerabilities in .html() and .attr() methods

Lodash prototype pollution in _.merge()

AngularJS client-side template injection

Scan Configuration:

Ensure your Veracode agent is configured to scan JavaScript files

Make sure SCA is enabled in your policy

Verify the agent has network access to download component databases

Important Notes
This code is for testing Veracode SCA capabilities only and should never be deployed to production.

The actual detection may vary based on:

Veracode agent version

Scan configuration

Policy settings

For comprehensive testing, you may want to:

Package this as a complete web application

Include package.json/npm dependencies

Add server-side components if testing full-stack detection
